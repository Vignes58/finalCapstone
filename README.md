Project: Sentiment Analysis and Review Similarity

Creator: Vigneswaran Vimalkumar

Overview:
This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual reviews and determine the similarity between two product reviews. It employs the spaCy library along with the TextBlob module for sentiment analysis.

How to Use:

Load and Preprocess Data: The data (e.g., CSV file with review text) is loaded and preprocessed to remove missing values and irrelevant characters.
Sentiment Analysis: A function is provided to analyze the sentiment of reviews using the TextBlob library. The sentiment is classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Test Sentiment Analysis: Sample reviews are provided to test the sentiment analysis function. The sentiment of each review is printed.
Write Report: A report is generated summarizing the dataset, preprocessing steps, evaluation of results, and insights into the model's strengths and limitations. This report is written to a file.
Test Similarity: The similarity between two product reviews is computed using spaCy. The similarity score is printed.
Where to Use:

This project can be used in various domains such as e-commerce, social media analysis, market research, and customer feedback analysis.
Businesses can utilize it to understand customer sentiments towards their products or services, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.
Researchers and analysts can leverage it to analyze public opinion, sentiment trends, and consumer behavior.
Note: Further refinement may be needed to improve accuracy, especially in handling mixed sentiments and nuanced expressions. Additionally, users should be mindful of biases in the training data and potential limitations of sentiment analysis models.
